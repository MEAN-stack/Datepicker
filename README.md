# Datepicker

There are a couple of places in my web application the user needs to enter a date, and optionally, a time.
Use cases are:

 * Date of birth - time not required, but date could be many years in the past.
 * Card expiry date - only month and year required.
 * Auction end date - limited to dates from now to 10 days in the future, optionally include a time.

In all cases it should be possible to set min and max allowed dates.
The control doesn't need to be fancy, just configurable, and simple to use.
And I want to avoid any posible confusion over day/month.

## HTML5
HTML5 `<input>` element has a `type="date"` attribute.
It is really nice to use in mobile Safari/Chrome on a handheld device, less usable on desktop Chrome, and not supported at all on IE or Firefox.

## Angular UI Bootstrap

Angular UI Bootstrap https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/ has a datepicker which works ok, and also a timepicker.
But the calendar-based datepicker has a completely different look and feel to the timepicker, and selecting dates several years in the past or future is a bit fiddly.

## My datepicker

My control will use simple set of `<input>` or `<select>` elements. Most of the configuration will be via a date format string. For example:

```HTML
<div my-datepicker format="ddMMMyyyy">
```

```HTML
<div my-datepicker format="MM/yy">
```

## &lt;input&gt;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&lt;select&gt;

It seems reasonable to use a `<select>` element to choose the month from a list of 12 options, but what about the day of the month? or the year.
Then again, in some configurations the range of dates may be restricted, so choosing a year in the range 2016 .. 2024 might be fine in a list, but 1900 .. 2099 would not.

For my first stab at this, I'm going to implement the following behaviours:

* Day selection always `<input>`
* Month selection always `<select>`
* Year selection uses `<select>` if the range is 12 years or less, otherwise uses `<input>`


## Quick Dates

This is a nice feature I have seen on some websites:

The list of quick dates is _ad hoc_ but bound to the other controls, so that choosing a date from the list will update the contents of the datepicker elements.
I'm not sure yet how to implement this feature, but I think that I will try to use Angular's transclusion feature.
